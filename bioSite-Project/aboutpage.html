        <h2>Short Bio</h2>

        <p>Libbie Barnes is an associate curator of exhibits at the Museum of History and Industry with a
           master’s degree in museum studies and has worked in the field of museums for over seven years.
           She is also my beloved wife, an amazing partner who shares many hobbies. We like going
           camping, playing board games together, doing arts and crafts, going to the movie theater, and
           owning a cat named Raven who is one year old, and a dog named Trixie who is turning ten years
           old this year.</p>
        <p>She is a great role model for me and those around her, with a higher education, and wonderful
           personalities, like cracking an occasional joke in a tense situation to alleviate stress while
           reminding those around her to live in the moment and not dwell on the past. Since working in
           museums for many years, we have visited many museums together, like the Museum of Pop
           Culture, the San Antonio Museum of Art, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, JAMNOLA,
           and many more. We are also yearly pass holders at our local zoo, which is a museum, and we
           love to visit our favorite animals each season.</p>
        <p>The future goal that Libbie has set is to work for a design company firm for museums to help
           communities thrive. This aligns with her love for community engagement and passion for the
           environment. More hobbies that align with these views are recycling unused clothes, thrift
           shopping, and cooking from home. Anyone would be amazed and enlightened to meet Libbie,
           who does not have to love museums but wants to learn how the world of museums works and
           impacts the surrounding community.</p>
